# React-Practical-7

- In this, I have designed the signUp form and the Home page.
- I have applied the form validations using yup and formik.
- I have used the redux-persist store and reducers for managing the state of the user.
- I have used developed the project using Vite.js and have used the styled components for designing the UI.
- The website is fully responsive.
- On submitting the form , the user will be redirected to the Home page.
- On the Home page, the user details will be displayed and there is a logout button.

## :sparkles: Functionalities:
1. The user can fill in the form and the form has all the validations that are required.
2. The signUp form can also be reset on clicking on the Reset button.
3. On submitting the form, the user is directed to the Home page.
4. The Home page contains all the details of the user and has a Logout button.
5. On clicking on the Logout button, the user is redirected to the SignUp form page.
6. If any other URL is entered by the user, then it will be redirected to the Page Not Found page.
